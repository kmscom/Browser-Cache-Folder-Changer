Here is a typical use-case scenario.

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Select a web browser. Here, we choose "Microsoft Edge". Following dialog will appear.

![Select User Profile](image/3.%20main_3.png)

Web browser's cache folder can be different based on the profile name.
If you don't know the profile name, then choose "Default".
If you know the profile name, then choose
- Profile 1
- Profile 2
- or, input custom name.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Select the browser's current cache folder
The default cache foldr path will be available at the edit control. If it does not match, click the "Select the Browser's Default Cache Folder" button and select one.

The current cache folder of "Microsoft Edge" may not exist if you had never executed the Edge browser. In that case, run the browser and quit. Then, retry.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Select the RAM Drive web cache top folder
Prepare a web cache top folder. You need to install the RAM drive application and configure in advance.

Here, we assume that "R:\webCacehTop\" is the web cache top folder.
Click the "Select a RAM Drive Folder (ex: R:\webCacheTop)" button and choose one.

![Select the Web Cache Top Folder](image/3.%20main_5.png)

Now, the Browser's New Cache Folder will be specified as followings.

![New Cache Folder](image/3.%20main_6.png)

You can see that "R:\webCacheTopFolder\edgeCache" is specified.

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Redirect cache folder
Now, by clicking "Redirect Cache Folder" button, you can create symbolic link for the "Browser's New Cache Folder".

C:\Users\CacheFolderChanger\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Edge\User Data\Default\Cache\Cache_Data
-->
R:\webCacheTop\edgeCache

If you click the "Redirect Cache Folder" button, you may meet the following error window.

![Process Check Error](image/3.%20main_7.png)

It means that the Microsoft Edge browser is running. If the browser process is running, we cannot change the browser's cache folder path. You should quit the browser and tr-try.

If you succeed in redirecting the browser's cache folder to a new cache folder path, then following window will appear.

![Redirect Cache Folder Success](image/3.%20main_8.png)

Also, the new cache folder will be appeared in the explorer.

#### Check if the browser cache folder is redirected successfully
We can check if the browser's cache folder is redirected successfully.
- Run the Microsoft Edge browser and check if the cache files are created successfully at the new cache folder.
